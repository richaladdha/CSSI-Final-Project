# paint socket lab

A server that serves a webpage, its resources, and handles passing data through sockets.


## Your Project

On the front-end,

- `public/index.html` is the default HTML file that will load our javascript when we serve it
- `public/script.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `public/index.html`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app (will) start at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json` (once we create it)
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
